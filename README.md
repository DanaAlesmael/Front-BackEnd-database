# Front-BackEnd-database

The main focus in this task was linking to my data (directions) to a database (based on phpMyadmin). The Frontend was coded using HTML and CSS to design the way the page looks while PHP language was utilized to activate the webs' functionalities such as allowing the user to insert values representing the movement distance, saving these data, displaying arrows, and so on. 

For easiness, the inserted data was inserted once in the web instead of creating a table and then each was streamed to phpMyadmin.

* The user has the ability to choose the function needed (delete, save, or start) after inserting a value. 
* Pressing save button will result the inserted value by the user to be shown in the website once, streamed to phpMyadmin, and then disapeared after writing another one. This was done for easiness.
* Pressing start button will result a picture to be shown which indicates the direction that the robot should be moved to.
